## team plan
### 1st team
- me
- lizaO
- andreas

# plan
## real timeline
### 1. speedrun to nether
- when found fortress: send liza and andreas to get blaze rods "for potions" (works well since strength pots need blaze poweder). (they spend time getting stuff like nether wart too)
- during this i get pearls, liza gives me 7 rods, and i leave to go to the stronghold
- andreas gets told i went to a trial chamber
- get gun powder and sugar cane when possible along the way
- if i didnt go into the end by the time the potions have been brewed then liza and andreas go search for trial chambers
### 2. End
- I go to stronghold
- get gun powder and sugar cane when possible along the way
- possibly get a trial chamber on the way for the achievement
- block off the portal room to make it difficult to follow me in
- trap the other side pf the portal with lava but have a boat in 1 spot to be able to get out if you know where it is
- kill dragon, enter gateway
### 3. end islands
- find first elytra
- fly around getting every city close by (aim is about 3k block radius around gateway
- when done, trap gateway
### 4. Monopoly
- make elytra shop to get netherite or some other resource we need

  

## fake timeline (for andreas)
### plan
- get basic stuff
- speedrun into nether
- we split apart to make more progress: liza and andreas go to get blaze rods so we can make strength potions (made using blaze powder). I go to find a trial chamber to hopefully get a mace (mace+strength (even without enchants) = over powered)
- if i didnt get a mace by the time potions have been made then liza and andreas go help do trial chambers
- once we have mace+pots we attack the other team repeatedly to halt their progress while 1 of us actually gets stuff done
- the hope is to get a mace on day 1


## transport/infastructure

### enderpearl
- lodestone remote stasis chamber hundreds of thousands - millions of blocks out
lodestones linked would be placed a few blocks under the surface in many locations (either 3 at each location for each player or we all have our own locations)
- pearl launchers at the same location to get back to ~spawn/important locations without anything actually at those locations

# Server Info
## Client side mods required:
[fabric api](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
[voice chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat)
information may be inaccurate. for more details and an installation guide check Moose's doc (pinned in tg)

## Gamerules
keepInventory = True
(carpet) optimizedFastEntityMovement = True

## Shopping/trading district:
**a no grief and no pvp zone** where items can be traded simply through chests (shop mod will not be used)
rules of the district are stated in the rules section

## Recording - General
I will record the server from my perspective and it will also be recorded with flashback (mod) server side for the following players:
- me
- lizaO

the gc chat/calls wont be recorded. (calls can be if everyone agrees that a specific call should be but by default its a no).

the final video will then be posted on youtube. the goal is to tell some sort of story through what has happened over whatever time it will be before i start editing (probably will be at least 2 weeks)

## Recording - Specific Players
**Katya** doesn't want her identity to be revealed in the final video so her name and skin will be obscured by a mod in the final video (her nickname and skin will be normal to everyone while playing) so refer to her as "the one with no name" or something like that, doesn't really matter as long as it isn't katya. maybe she could get a name because of some lore.

## Rules
> **don't use cheats**. an example is x-ray but things like using flashback or replay mod to record **and then use it like freecam** are also considered cheating. **schematics mods and map mods are also considered cheating.** 

> griefing or stealing **is** allowed **if** at least 1 member of that team is currently online. otherwise it isn't

> don't use anyones real name in recorded text/audio, use their in-game name

> you cannot go to the trading district to escape a pvp fight

> you can not steal items from other people's shops
